This is just a short little text file with stuff in it to test whether or not Writing Mate works.
Whoever is reading this, I hope that you are having a good day! In the case that your day isn't going spectacularly, 
here are a couple of jokes to hopefully brighten in up a little bit:

What kind of shorts to clouds wear?
Thunderwear!

What do you call a thieving alligator?
A crookadile!

What do you call a bear with no teeth?
A gummy bear!

What do you call a pig that does karate?
A pork chop!

What did the farmer say when he lost his tractor?
Where's my tractor?!

Disclaimer: these jokes are not mine! I found most of them on pinterest and just think they're really funny. 
I'm also writing this at 5 in the morning so everything is funny! Hope you found these jokes funny, but not that you are reading
this at a time similar to me, and also that I will pass this class!!!
